# Empirical-Study
ðŸ‘‰ A traceability survey of application-grade cross-chain bridges.

## ðŸ’¡ Research introduction

> [Chainspot](https://chainspot.io/), the website with the largest number of cross-chain bridges recorded at present.


According to Chainspot, there are currently 114 recorded cross-chain bridges. We launched an empirical study to assess the traceability of these bridges, examining various aspects, including their official websites, open source documentation, contract addresses and codes, and transaction tracking services. As an intermediary between different blockchain networks, the transparency of cross-chain bridges profoundly affects how much users trust them.
